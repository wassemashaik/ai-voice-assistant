# Voice Assistant - Fixed Version

This is a corrected version of the Streamlit voice assistant application with all major bugs fixed.

## What Was Fixed

### Major Bug Fixes:
1. **Audio Format Issues**: Fixed float32 to int16 conversion with proper scaling
2. **Sample Rate Handling**: Dynamic sample rate detection from WebRTC frames
3. **Thread Safety**: Local TTS engine initialization to prevent threading issues
4. **Memory Management**: Proper audio buffer management with clear lifecycle
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with cleanup
6. **File Cleanup**: Proper temporary file management with try-finally blocks
7. **API Validation**: OpenAI API key validation before usage
8. **WebRTC State**: Better WebRTC context state management
9. **Dependencies**: Added dependency checking at startup
10. **Session Management**: Improved session state handling

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key (optional):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. For local LLM (Ollama), install and run:
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Run Mistral model
ollama run mistral
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run fixed_voice_assistant.py
```

2. Choose your LLM provider:
   - **Local (Ollama)**: Uses local Mistral model
   - **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: Uses OpenAI API (requires API key)

3. Record or upload audio:
   - **Live Recording**: Click START, speak, then "Stop and Transcribe"
   - **File Upload**: Upload MP3, WAV, or M4A files

4. Get AI responses and optionally use text-to-speech

## Key Improvements

- **Robust Audio Processing**: Handles various audio formats and sample rates
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear error reporting with logging
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Thread Safe**: Prevents issues in multi-user environments
- **Validation**: Checks dependencies and API keys before starting
- **State Management**: Proper WebRTC and session state handling

## Technical Details

- Audio is converted to mono 16-bit WAV format automatically
- Sample rates are detected dynamically from WebRTC frames
- TTS engines are initialized per-use to avoid threading issues
- All temporary files are properly cleaned up
- API keys are validated before making requests
- Dependencies are checked at startup

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Microphone access for live recording
- Internet connection for OpenAI API (if used)
- Local Ollama installation (if using local LLM)

The fixed version is much more stable and handles edge cases that would cause the original code to fail.
